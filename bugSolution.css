Here is a solution using flexbox:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.parent {
  display: flex;
}
```

This solution uses flexbox which is more reliable for managing layouts and doesn't have the same issues associated with the `float` property. With `box-sizing: border-box` the padding and border of the element are included in the 50% calculation.
